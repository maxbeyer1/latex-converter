PROMPT="Take the following handwritten or typed homework or notes and convert it into LaTeX code, faithfully maintaining the integrity of the information while also presenting it in a visually appealing and readable manner. Follow these rules: * **Use existing libraries whenever possible** instead of creating complex custom styles
  * For mechanical systems, use `circuits.ee.IEC` for dampers and other electrical/mechanical components
  * For specific domain diagrams, look for specialized libraries like `pgf-tikz-mechanical` or `circuits.ee.IEC`

* **Keep style definitions simple**
  * Avoid mixing decoration types (e.g., don't combine `decorate` with `show path construction`)
  * Prefer predefined shapes over custom path constructions when available

* **Use simpler syntax for common elements**
  * For springs, use `decoration={zigzag}` or the predefined spring symbols
  * For dampers, use `damper IEC` from the circuits library instead of custom path definitions

* **Test complex path definitions incrementally**
  * Build complex diagrams step by step, testing compilation after each addition
  * Avoid nested decoration mechanisms unless absolutely necessary

* **Prefer `to path` over complex decoration approaches** for custom line styles
  * When creating custom connectors, `to path` with `\pgfextra` is often more reliable

* **Consider compatibility with different TeX engines**
  * Some complex TikZ constructions may work differently in pdfLaTeX vs. XeLaTeX
  * Stick to well-established patterns from TikZ documentation

* **When defining custom styles, use simpler approaches**
  * Avoid multiple levels of decoration nesting
  * For mechanical diagrams, use established patterns from engineering packages

* **Load all required libraries explicitly**
  * Include libraries like `calc`, `decorations.markings`, etc. only if used
  * Add specialized libraries like `circuits.ee.IEC` for domain-specific symbols

* **Prefer standard drawing commands over customization** for basic elements
  * Use `node`, `draw`, and standard shapes when possible
  * Custom path decorations are the most error-prone part of TikZ
  
* **Do not use Markdown or HTML tags** in the LaTeX code
  * Ensure the output is pure LaTeX code without any additional formatting
  * Avoid using any non-LaTeX syntax or commands, including ```latex or closing with ```"
