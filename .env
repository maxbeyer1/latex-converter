# Base prompt for PDF to LaTeX conversion
PROMPT="Convert this PDF to LaTeX code. Your goal is to create an exact representation of the original content, maintaining all:
- Mathematical notation exactly as written
- Formatting, including indentation and spacing
- Layout of text, equations, and other elements
- Errors or unusual notations (do not correct them)
Focus on faithful reproduction rather than improvement or correction. If something is ambiguous, choose the most likely LaTeX representation based on the visual appearance."

# Specialized prompt for equations
EQUATION_PROMPT="When handling mathematical equations:
1. Preserve the exact mathematical notation as written
2. Maintain the original structure and layout
3. Use appropriate LaTeX environments (align, gather, cases, etc.)
4. Do not attempt to correct or improve notation
5. Preserve any unusual or non-standard notation"

# Specialized prompt for diagrams
DIAGRAM_PROMPT="When creating diagrams with TikZ/PGF code:
1. PRIORITIZE RELIABLE COMPILATION over perfect visual accuracy
2. Keep diagrams SIMPLE - complex diagrams will be replaced with placeholders
3. Follow these diagram-specific best practices:
   * Use existing libraries whenever possible (circuits.ee.IEC for mechanical components)
   * Keep style definitions SIMPLE and avoid decoration mixing
   * Use predefined shapes over custom path constructions
   * For springs, use simple decoration={zigzag} with limited number of segments
   * For dampers, use damper IEC from circuits library
   * For electrical circuits, use circuit symbols from circuits.ee.IEC library
   * For flowcharts, use simple rectangles, diamonds, and arrows
   * AVOID complex decorations and nested path modifications
   * LIMIT the number of nodes to under 15 per diagram
   * LIMIT the number of paths/lines to under 20 per diagram
   * Break complex diagrams into MULTIPLE SEPARATE tikzpicture environments
   * Use simplified coordinate systems (avoid complicated calculations)"

# Specialized prompt for document structure
STRUCTURE_PROMPT="Analyze this PDF document and extract its logical structure. Identify and classify each content block into one of these categories:
- headers (titles, section headings)
- text (regular paragraphs)
- simple_equation (inline or short math)
- complex_equation (displayed, multi-line, or intricate math)
- theorem (includes lemmas, proofs)
- list (numbered or bulleted)
- table
- diagram (TikZ graphics, flowcharts, circuits, illustrations)
- figure (non-TikZ graphics, plots, images)
- citation
- special (other formatted environments)"

# Judge prompt for tiebreaking
JUDGE_PROMPT="Select the best LaTeX code option from the following alternatives. Choose the option that:
1. Is most likely to compile without errors
2. Best represents the original content
3. Uses the most appropriate LaTeX environments and commands
4. Is the cleanest and most maintainable
Respond ONLY with the number of the best option."

# Syntax validation prompt
SYNTAX_PROMPT="Review this LaTeX code and identify any syntax errors or issues that would prevent successful compilation. Focus on:
1. Missing or mismatched braces, brackets, or parentheses
2. Unclosed environments or missing end commands
3. Undefined commands or environments
4. Package conflicts or missing dependencies
5. Improper nesting of environments
If no issues are found, respond with 'NO_ISSUES_FOUND'."
