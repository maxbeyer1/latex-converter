PROMPT="Convert this handwritten or typed content into LaTeX code. Your goal is to create an exact representation of the original content, maintaining all:
- Mathematical notation exactly as written
- Formatting, including indentation and spacing
- Layout of text, equations, and other elements
- Errors or unusual notations (do not correct them)

Focus on faithful reproduction rather than improvement or correction. If something is ambiguous, choose the most likely LaTeX representation based on the visual appearance."

STRUCTURE_PROMPT="Analyze this PDF document and extract its logical structure. Identify and classify each content block into one of these categories: headers (titles, section headings), text (regular paragraphs), simple_equation (inline or short math), complex_equation (displayed, multi-line, or intricate math), theorem (includes lemmas, proofs), list (numbered or bulleted), table, figure, citation, special (other formatted environments). For each block, provide: 1. A unique ID 2. The block type 3. Page number 4. Approximate coordinates or region description 5. A brief content summary. Return the results as a JSON object with this structure: {\"blocks\": [{\"id\": \"block1\", \"type\": \"header\", \"page\": 1, \"region\": \"top\", \"summary\": \"Introduction\"}, {\"id\": \"block2\", \"type\": \"complex_equation\", \"page\": 1, \"region\": \"middle\", \"summary\": \"Main theorem equation\"}]}"

EQUATION_PROMPT="Convert the following mathematical equation from the PDF into LaTeX code. Focus only on the specified region/block, not the entire document. Create a direct transcription that:
1. Preserves the exact mathematical notation as written
2. Maintains the original structure and layout
3. Uses appropriate LaTeX environments (align, gather, cases, etc.)
4. Does not attempt to correct or improve notation
5. Preserves any unusual or non-standard notation

Your output should contain ONLY the LaTeX code for this equation, without any explanations or markdown formatting."

VALIDATION_PROMPT="You are a LaTeX syntax validator. Review the following LaTeX code and ensure it is syntactically valid:
1. Fix critical syntax errors that would prevent compilation (missing braces, incorrect environments, etc.)
2. Ensure all environments are correctly opened and closed
3. Verify command usage is valid for LaTeX processing
4. Do NOT alter the mathematical content or notation in any way
5. Do NOT 'correct' unusual or non-standard notation
6. Make minimal changes to ensure compilability while preserving the original content exactly

Return ONLY the validated LaTeX code without explanations."
